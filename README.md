## :woman_technologist: Expertise

With a background in accounting and a postgraduate degree in corporate finance, I built a multidisciplinary foundation through my career at companies such as Deloitte and Serasa Experian and banking institutions like Safra and Santander. I gained years of experience in the financial sector, analyzing businesses in industries, retail, and services with a focus on risk and credit.

Seeking new challenges and growth opportunities, I transitioned to product management in an e-commerce setting. For five years, I was responsible for strategic planning, operational management, and overseeing the entire product lifecycle.

This journey has significantly enhanced my skill set, equipping me to effectively bridge the strategic gap between Technology, Product Development, and Business Vision.

With a keen focus on agile innovation, I am continuously motivated to expand my knowledge through courses, mentorship, and participation in professional groups. My objective is to stay ahead of market trends and seek insights that enable me to create solutions that positively impact people's lives and add value.
